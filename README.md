## Server-side APIs(Application Programming Interfaces):
refer to a set of protocols and tools that allow different software<br>
applictions to communicate with each other. In the context of web<br>
development, server-side APIs are commonly used to enable communucation<br> 
between a client-side appliction(such as a web browser) and a server.
 
  Here are key aspects related to server-side APIs:
  1.Communication
  <br>
  2.Functionality
  <br>
  3.Data Exchange
  <br>
  4.HTTP Methods
  <br>
  5.Data Formats
  <br>
  6.Authentication
  <br>
  7.Frameworks and Libraries
  <br>
  8.Statelessness
 <br>

## Git branching workflow:
   is a strategy or set of guidelines that developers follow when<br>   
workin with Git, a distributed version control system. Branching allows <br>
developers to create a independent lines of development, making it<br> 
workflows exist, but a commonly used one is the "Feature Branch Workflow". 
Here's an overview:
 1. Main Branch(Master/Main):
 <br>
- The main branch represents the stable version of the project. It should <br>
always be in a deployable state, meaning it contains the latest production-ready code.
 <br>
 2. Feature Branches:
 <br>
When a new feature or task needs to be implemented, a developer creates a new<br>
branch dedicated to that specific feature. This is called a "feature branch".<br>
The developer workers on the feature independently of the main branch.
3. Creating a Feature Branch:
<br>
- To creating a feature branch, developers typically use the following commands:

  git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

  This command creates and switches to a new branch named "feature/new-feature-name."
  
4. Development on Feature Branch:
<br>
- Developers make changes, add new code, and commit their work to the feature branch. <br>
This allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without<br>
interfering with each other.
<br>
5. Regular Updates:
<br>
- while working on the feature branch, developers regularly pull the latest changes<br>
from the main brancr to ensure their feature branch is based on the most recent code.

  git pull origin main

6. Code Review: 
- Once the feature is complete, the developer opens a pull request (PR) to merge<br>
their feature branch into the main branch. This is an oppertunity  for code review<br>
and collaboration with other team members.
<br>
7. Integration and Testing:
<br>
- The feature branch undergoes integration testing to ensure that it works well with<br>
the existing codebase. This step helps identify and resolve conflicts or issues that<br>
may arise from the merge.
<br>
8. Merge into Main:
<br> 
- After the code review and successful testing, the feature branch is merged into<br>
the main branch. This integraion brings the new feature into the stable codebage.

9. Tagging Releases:
<br>
- After  significant features or bug fixes, a release may be tagged in the main branch.<br>
Thi allows for identificatin of specific versions and helps with version control.

   This brnching workflow promotes a systematic and collaboratve approach to development.<br>
Ungerstanding Git branching workflow is crucial for effective collaboration in software<br>
development projects.

## Agile software development
<br>

Agile software development is an iterative approach to software development that emphsizes<br>
flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It contrasts with traditional "waterfall"<br>
methods by breaking the development process into smaller increments called iteration or sprints,<br>
allowing for incremental improvements and adjustments thoughout the project lifecycle. Here are<br>
key principales and characteristics of Agile software development:

-  Iterative and Incremental Development
<br>
-  Customer Collaboration
<br>
-  Adaptive Planing
<br>
-  Cross-Funtional Teams
<br>
-  Continuous Integration and Delivery
<br>
-  Emphasis on Individuals and Interactions
<br>
-  Working Software as primary Measure of Progress
<br>
-  Embracing Change
<br>
<br>

Common Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (PX), and Lean Software<br>
Development, eatch with its own set of practices and principles tailored to different project<br>
contexts. By promoting collaborating, adaptability, and customer-centricity, Agile methodologes<br>
aim to deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs efficiently and effectively.
