## Server-side APIs(Application Programming Interfaces):
refer to a set of protocols and tools that allow different software<br>
applictions to communicate with each other. In the context of web<br>
development, server-side APIs are commonly used to enable communucation<br> 
between a client-side appliction(such as a web browser) and a server.
 
  Here are key aspects related to server-side APIs:
  1.Communication
  <br>
  2.Functionality
  <br>
  3.Data Exchange
  <br>
  4.HTTP Methods
  <br>
  5.Data Formats
  <br>
  6.Authentication
  <br>
  7.Frameworks and Libraries
  <br>
  8.Statelessness

# Git branching workflow:

is a strategy or set of guidelines that developers follow when working with Git, a distributed version control system. Branching allows developers to create independent lines of development, making workflows exist, but a commonly used one is the "Feature Branch Workflow".

Here's an overview:

1.  Main Branch(Master/Main):

- The main branch represents the stable version of the project. It should always be in a deployable state, meaning it contains the latest production-ready code.

2. Feature Branches: When a new feature or task needs to be implemented, a developer creates a new branch dedicated to that specific feature. This is called a "feature branch".The developer workers on the feature independently of the main branch.
3. Creating a Feature Branch:

- To create a feature branch, developers typically use the following commands:

```bash
  git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```

This command creates and switches to a new branch named "feature/new-feature-name."

4. Development on Feature Branch:

- Developers make changes, add new code, and commit their work to the feature branch. This allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other.

5. Regular Updates:

- while working on the feature branch, developers regularly pull the latest changes
  from the main branch to ensure their feature branch is based on the most recent code.

```bash
  git pull origin main
```

6. Code Review:

- Once the feature is complete, the developer opens a pull request (PR) to merge their feature branch into the main branch. This is an opportunity for code review and collaboration with other team members.

7. Integration and Testing:

- The feature branch undergoes integration testing to ensure that it works well with
  the existing codebase. This step helps identify and resolve conflicts or issues that may arise from the merge.

8. Merge into Main:

- After the code review and successful testing, the feature branch is merged into
  the main branch. This integration brings the new feature into the stable code base.

9. Tagging Releases:

- After significant features or bug fixes, a release may be tagged in the main branch. This allows for the identification of specific versions and helps with version control.
  This branching workflow promotes a systematic and collaborative approach to development.
  Understanding Git branching workflow is crucial for effective collaboration in software development projects.


# Agile software development


Agile software development is an iterative approach to software development that emphasises flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It contrasts with traditional "waterfall" methods by breaking the development process into smaller increments called iterations or sprints, allowing for incremental improvements and adjustments throughout the project lifecycle. Here are key principles and characteristics of Agile software development:

- Iterative and Incremental Development
- Customer Collaboration
- Adaptive Planning
- Cross-Functional Teams
- Continuous Integration and Delivery
- Emphasis on Individuals and Interactions
- Working Software as a primary Measure of Progress
- Embracing Change
  Common Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (PX), and Lean Software Development, each with its own set of practices and principles tailored to different project contexts. By promoting collaboration, adaptability, and customer-centricity, Agile methodologies aim to deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs efficiently and effectively.
